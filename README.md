Experiments with OpenGL 4.5 Compute Shaders using Rust.

These gpu programs were written while following [CS344 Introduction to Parallel Programming](https://github.com/udacity/cs344). The class uses CUDA, which would
have made this work much easier (or at least, I would have worked with much better documentation), but I have decided to use OpenGL instead.
This is because the aim of this exploration was to develop a compute shader for blazing fast occlusion detection, which I needed for a game I was developing.

Many of the implementation details come from [GPU Gems 3 - Chapter 39](https://developer.nvidia.com/gpugems/gpugems3/part-vi-gpu-computing/chapter-39-parallel-prefix-sum-scan-cuda).
